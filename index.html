    <h4>These superhero skins are all incredibly scary and were released in chapter 2 season 4 during the Marvel season. </h4>
     <p>Superhero skins are the peak of try-hard skins, it seems like every single pro uses these because of the ability to customize the skin so that they can match/blend in with their surroundings. Although there is a nearly endless colour combination customization, most players just seem to either go for plain white or black because of the advandtage these give. Every skin in the boundless set costs 1800 vbucks and comes with a build in emote and an emoticon, which is quite good value for what you're getting. If you would want to pick one of these skins up you may have to wait a little since sometimes it is quite inconsistent on when they return.</p>
